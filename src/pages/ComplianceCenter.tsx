                the FTC sent warning letters to 97 auto dealership groups across the United States

            The CARS Rule was vacated in January 2025 — but the FTC's authority under <strong>Section 5
            of the FTC Act</strong> (prohibiting unfair or deceptive practices) was NOT affected. The March 2026
            letters prove the FTC is actively using Section 5 to enforce the same principles the CARS Rule
            would have codified.
          </p>
          <p className="text-xs text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-3">
            Additionally, states are filling the gap with their own laws. California's CARS Act (SB 766)
            takes effect October 1, 2026 with even stricter requirements than the federal CARS Rule
            would have imposed.

            By using this platform, the dealership ("<strong>{storeName}</strong>") acknowledges the following:
          </p>

          <div className="space-y-3 text-xs text-foreground leading-relaxed">
            <p><strong>1. OPPORTUNITY FOR LEGAL REVIEW.</strong> The dealership has been given the opportunity to have its legal counsel review all disclosure language, addendum verbiage, and compliance templates provided by this platform before adoption and use.</p>

            <p><strong>2. CUSTOMIZATION RIGHTS.</strong> The dealership may request modifications to any disclosure language, addendum wording, or compliance template at any time. Requested changes will be reviewed and implemented by the platform provider in a reasonable timeframe.</p>

            <p><strong>3. ADOPTION OF DISCLOSURES.</strong> If the dealership proceeds without requesting changes, the dealership voluntarily adopts all standard disclosure language, addendum templates, and compliance verbiage as its own. The dealership represents that it is satisfied with the content and accuracy of these materials for its jurisdiction and business operations.</p>

            <p><strong>4. DUAL SIGNATURE RECOMMENDATION.</strong> We strongly recommend that both the dealership principal AND the dealership's legal counsel sign this adoption agreement. However, if only the dealership principal signs, the principal acknowledges that they were given the opportunity to involve legal counsel and chose to proceed independently.</p>

            <p><strong>5. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.</strong> This platform provides disclosure language and compliance templates based on industry best practices and current federal and state law research. However, the platform provider is NOT a law firm and does NOT provide legal advice. The dealership assumes full responsibility for ensuring its disclosures comply with all applicable laws in its operating jurisdiction(s). The dealership's own legal counsel is the appropriate party to confirm compliance. The platform provider shall not be held liable for any regulatory action, fine, or penalty resulting from the dealership's use of these templates if the dealership chose not to have them reviewed by its own legal counsel.</p>

            <p><strong>6. STATE-SPECIFIC COMPLIANCE.</strong> The disclosure templates have been configured for the state of <strong>{compliance.stateName || "your state"}</strong> based on our research of current state requirements. State laws change. The dealership is responsible for notifying the platform provider of any changes in state requirements that may affect their disclosures.</p>

            <p><strong>7. RECORD RETENTION.</strong> All signed addendums, customer interactions, and compliance records are retained for a minimum of {compliance.recordRetentionYears} years in accordance with applicable federal and state record retention requirements.</p>
